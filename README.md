# To-do_app_Django

Project is done using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python framework Django.
Application enables adding, deleting and modyfying notes which are stored in a main page.
One user can have few accounts with separate 'to-do' list but needs to be logged in in order to access them.
Elements which are not marked as complete are pushed to the top, so that user can see them first.
Apart from above, application does everything as I had in my vision.

To run the project, one needs to do standard Django flow, which is:
-having installed Python and Django
-running code in cmd: 'python manage.py runserver'
-going to local-host adress in the browser
